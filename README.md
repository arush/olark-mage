Olark Live Chat for Magento
====================
by @ldn_tech_exec


If you work with Magento, follow me on twitter, check my favourites, I generally have some cool stuff to say.

What it does
---------------------

Installation is pretty straight forward, just remember to log in/log out and clear cache afterwards. Olark have some really cool APIs so I decided to make use of some of them. Feel free to improve on this and send me a pull request.


> 1. Simple installation, no template file modding required
> 
> 2. For logged in users, adds full name and email address to chat name
>
> 3. If Olark is linked to your CRM, name and email address also updates your CRM from Magento
>
> 4. Detects hesitations and sends a live chat request to operator so you can help out your customers. This also sends details of the page they are on, so very handy if they are on /checkout/onepage/ - close those sales!
>
> 5. Define what constitutes an hesitation in the admin
